# Drawing for a Tournament
I wrote for a table tennis tournament I was orginizing in the deparment.

## Competitors List
Each were listed on a new line as the following:

- firstname lastname studentID

## Usage
Create your own list of competitors.


```shell
$ c99 draw.c -o draw

$ ./draw list.txt
```

It will print everything to standart output, and finally ask for a filename to
save full fixture.
